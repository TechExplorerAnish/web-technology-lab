<!--
Create a multi-section webpage using semantic HTML elements
only. The webpage should include a <header> section containing
the title of the website, a <nav> section with navigation links,
multiple <section> elements for different content areas, and a
<footer> section for footer information. Each navigation link should
use anchor tags (<a>) to scroll to its corresponding section using
section id attributes. Ensure proper use of semantic tags,
meaningful section headings, and well-structured HTML code.
Navigation between sections should work correctly when the links
are clicked.

            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially
                computer systems.
                It enables systems to learn from data, recognize patterns, reason, solve problems, and make
                decisions—tasks that typically require human cognition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language (e.g., virtual assistants
                        like Siri or Alexa).

            <h2>Evolution and Impact</h2>
            <p>AI has evolved from early rule-based expert systems to today’s data-driven, self-learning models. While
                narrow AI excels at specific tasks, general AI—machines with human-like reasoning across diverse
                domains—remains a long-term goal.

            </p>

            <p> AI is transforming industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, and education, enabling
                automation, efficiency, and innovation.

                Despite its benefits, AI raises ethical concerns such as bias, transparency (the "black box" problem),
                and job displacement, making responsible development essential.</p>
