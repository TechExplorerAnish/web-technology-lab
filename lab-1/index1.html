        Artificial Intelligence (<strong>AI</strong>) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines
        capable of intelligent behavior.
        It involves the development of algorithms and systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human
        intelligence, such as
        learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding natural language.
        <em>AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries</em>, including healthcare, finance, and
        transportation.
